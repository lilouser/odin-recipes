    <h3>A recipe even my dog can follow</h3>
    <p>
        This is the most simple recipe out there. It's just as easy as making rice in a rice cooker but takes 5 minutes max(curse those fancy rice makers that take 45 minutes to cook). 
    </p>
    <h3>What you'll need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp dashi powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp vegetable oil</li>tatus
    </ul>
    <h3>Let's get started!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the egg and add in the dashi powder.</li>
        <li><em><strong>Make sure to use a square pan to create a crisp edge.</strong></em>Preheat your pan on low medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add your oil into a ramuken and use a folded paper towel along with a pair of chopsticks or tongs to evenly saturate the pan with a light coat of oil.</li>
        <li>Pour a small amount of your egg mixture to the pan. <em><strong>Keep the layer light and thin so it folds easily.</strong></em></li>
        <li>The best way to fold the egg into a roll is by using two spatulas: one to keep the egg in place and the other to do the actual folding over. Keep folding until it's in the shape of a log and push to one side of the pan. Repeat steps 3-5 until you use up all the egg mixture.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>That simple! The technique might be tricky at first but you'll be a tamagoyaki master in no time!</h3>
