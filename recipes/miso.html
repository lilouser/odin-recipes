    <p>
        Ahhh yes, miso soup: the start of a wonderful Japanese meal (unless you chose salad, which if you did that sucks because you're missing out on a warm bowl of delicious probiotics.) Coffee shops are judged based on their espresso shots, southern restaurants are judged based on their sweet tea, and as for Japanese restaurants, I'd argue that they're judged based on the quality of their miso soup. In this recipe, I'll show you how to make miso soup just like how they make it at your favorite sushi spot. You'll be surprised at how simple it is to make!
